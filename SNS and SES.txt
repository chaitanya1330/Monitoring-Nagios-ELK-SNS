SES through Cloudwatch implemented : same like that but we didnt implement
Here we can send emails from one to one
                             one to many
                             many to many 
                             one inside one 
SNS through Cloudwatch implemented :

1) created ec2 instance 
2) go to cloudwatch and create an alarm and give the metrics
 metrics should be cpu utilization in avg mode
with instance_id --"id"
if threshold increases 25 then alarm will send to my mail and instance will automatically stop

configuring sns:
create a topic :You create an SNS topic within your AWS account.
               Each topic is assigned a unique Amazon Resource Name (ARN) 
               that serves as its identifier.

Let's consider a real-time example involving a news service that utilizes Amazon SNS topics.
Service: News Alert System ---topic name
Subscribers:
Subscriber 1: Email subscriber (john@example.com)
Subscriber 2: SMS subscriber (8179151958)
Subscriber 3: Lambda function (NotifyBreakingNews)
Publishing a Breaking News Alert:

The News Alert System receives breaking news about an important event.
The system publishes a message to the "BreakingNewsAlerts" topic.

Thats it!!! in our case --topic is cloudwatch_alarm
ans subcriber is me through my email -chaitanyavantaku@gmail.com
message is :HEy team::!! instance cpu is grater than its threshold;;;

We can also create log groups for our instance ..but we should install 
cloudwatch agent inside or linux server and small stuff to do
